      Foundations of Algorithmic Trading
    </p>

    <p>
      This course is designed to build a solid foundation in trading and finance
      before moving into automation.
      You will learn how markets actually work, how brokers execute trades and
      why concepts like spreads, margin, leverage and risk management matter in
      real trading environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The focus is not on shortcuts or indicators, but on understanding the
      mechanics behind every automated system.
      By the end of the course, you will clearly understand what changes when
      moving from demo to real capital.
